parameters:
    parameters (params from now on) are any kind of data member owned by the scene or object.
    a param can either be a constant value or an expression based on other params/constants.
        param values are calculated every frame.
        cyclic dependencies are not allowed. no 'x = y; y = x;' nonsense.
        this is so params can be evaulated one-by-one in the compiled shader. 
    a scene param can only reference other scene params, it does not have access to object params.
    an object param can only reference scene params and params from the same object.
