parameters:
    parameters are any kind of data member owned by the scene or object.
    a parameter can either be a constant value or an expression based on other parameters/constants.
        parameters are calculated every frame, so no need to worry about expressions not being updated.
        no cyclic dependencies are not allowed. no 'x = y; y = x;' nonsense.
        this is so parameters can be evaulated one-by-one in the compiled shader.
    
    a scene parameter can only reference other scene parameters, it does not have access to object params.
    an object parameter can only reference scene parameters and params from the same object.
