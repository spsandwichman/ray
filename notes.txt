parameters:
    parameters (params from now on) are any kind of data member owned by the scene or object.
    a param can either be a constant value or an expression based on other params/constants.
        param values are calculated every frame.
        cyclic dependencies are not allowed. no 'x = y; y = x;' nonsense.
        this is so params can be evaulated one-by-one in the compiled shader. 
    a scene param can only reference other scene params, it does not have access to object params.
    an object param can only reference scene params and params from the same object.

determine param evaluation order: (assuming no cyclic dependencies)
    put all params into a list (arbitrary position)
    use a sorting algorithm (i like selection sort) with:
        if a param depends on the param it is compared with, reorder
        so that the dependent param is evaluated after the independent.
        (sorting in ascending order, dependent param > independent param)

        probably going to use a sort that does well on already sorted lists since 
        you usually won't have huge networks of dependencies. (smoothsort??)
